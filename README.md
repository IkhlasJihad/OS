Operating Systems projects
    
Here are some college and personal OS projects I worked on to get theory into practice by coding and simulation.
1. [cpu scheduler](https://github.com/IkhlasJihad/OS/tree/main/cpu_schedulers)
2. [shell](https://github.com/IkhlasJihad/OS/tree/main/shell)
3. [Concurrency problem](https://github.com/IkhlasJihad/Concurrent-Search-Insert-Delete-)
